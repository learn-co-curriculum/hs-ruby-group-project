##BUILD BUILD BUILD

###The Build Up

Think back to week one when we learned how to use terminal. Heck we even learned what terminal is. We blew through all the Ruby basics (data types, variables, methods, data structures..the list goes on). We've covered a LOT of material so far, and today's the day we put that knowledge to the test.

### The Task

You are all going to be assigned to group of 3-5 students. As a group, you must build a command line calculator. 

### The Instructions
**1** You must spend the first 5 minutes as a group with laptops down mapping out the features you want to build and how you want a user to use your calculator

**2** Keep in mind MVP (minimum viable product)

**3** Remember, every design decision has a tradeoff. Focusing on one thing means you won't have time to focus on another

**4** You have an hour and 15 minutes to build

**5** Make sure your final project is hosted on Github.com and that every group member has collaborator access to the repository.

###Presentations

**1** Every group must present and every group member must help present

**2** Presentation should include a demo of your application as well as a description of the hardest technical challenge you faced while building your application
